<h3>What</h3>
<p> Build Me a Bike Rack is a mapping app for communities to collaborate on bulk orders of new bike racks.</p>

<h3> Why </h3>
<p> New York City has seen a dramatic increase in bicycling lately, but the lack of secure legal bike parking is still a deterrent to many. NYC DOT’s CityRacks program currently accepts one-off rack location requests from the public, but their process is better served by a bulk order to install en masse in an entire neighborhood. Better yet, if community groups will do some outreach and assessment work to ensure requests meet DOT requirements and won’t anger storeowners, CityRacks can get the order on the ground even quicker. This app helps community groups and the broader public work together to make [this process LINK] easier and more open. </p>

<h3> Where</h3>
<p> Our pilot project is focused on Brooklyn Community Board 1 (BKCB1) and only suggestions in this area will be editable in this trial period. The Transportation Alternatives Brooklyn Committee is orchestrating the BKCB1 bulk order. This site will grow along with their process, enabling users to submit a bulk order to the CityRacks program and keep track of its progress. We plan to scale this site for use throughout the city as soon as possible, but suggestions can be made anywhere in the five boroughs in the meantime. It has been specified to the NYC CityRacks workflow and requirements, so suggestions cannot be made outside NYC at this time. </p>

<h3> Who</h3>
<p> Build Me a Bike Rack is brought to you by the Livable Streets Initiative, The Open Planning Project, and Transportation Alternatives Brooklyn Committee. Special thanks to CityRacks Manager Jason Accime for his support and guidance. </p>

<h3> What can you do?</h3>
<p> You can submit suggestions for places you’d like bike racks anywhere in NYC, use this feature to start planning a bulk order with others in your community, or contact the Brooklyn Transportation Alternatives committee to assess some spots in BKCB1. </p>


<h3> Contact </h3>
<p> If you’d like to get involved with the BKCB1 bulk order contact Dan Latorre: </p>
