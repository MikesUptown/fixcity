refactor this stuff...
https://projects.openplans.org/fixcity/ticket/159

General pattern, maybe a Template Method kind of thing:

* get ID of last processed input

* get new data since last ID

* for each:
  - parse or adapt data
  - create new rack:
    * create a source (seeclickfix only... should be done server-side)
    * on user error:
      - adapt errors to source-specific format
      - send msg
    * on exception:
      - adapt errors to source-specific format
      - send msg
      - email admins
    * save ID as last processed item, unless server is down
      (or some other retryable failure)
