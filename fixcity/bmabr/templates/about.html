  <h3>What</h3>
  <p>fixcity.org is about taking small steps to fix your city--from structural issues like sidewalks to amenities like bike racks. Our first endeavor, FixCity:Bike Racks, is a mapping application designed to enable community/government collaboration in the gathering, planning, and implementation of new bike racks.</p>
  <p>This application encourages you to suggest new bike racks, verify suggested locations, gather statements of support from the broader community, and finally submit a "shovel-ready" bulk order to the Department of Transportation. This application is designed in collaboration with the CityRacks Program at the NYC DOT as a means to engage citizens in government processes.</p>
  <h3>Why</h3>
  <p>At <a href="http://openplans.org/about/">The Open Planning Project</a>, we strive to promote open government and civic engagement. We believe these goals compliment each other and that making the channels of communication from citizen to citizen, and citizen to government more transparent will allow us to efficiently fix our cities. FixCity encourages communities to give their input intelligently to optimize government workflow, building in the layer of transparency. FixCity is related to a larger <a href="http://open311.org/">Open 311</a> initiative at The Open Planning Project.</p>
  <h3>Why Bike Racks?</h3>
  <p>New York City has seen a dramatic increase in bicycling, but the lack of secure, legal bike parking is still a deterrent to many. NYC DOT’s CityRacks program currently accepts one-off rack requests from the public, but their process is better served by a "bulk order" that spans an entire neighborhood. The bulk order process involves surveying the area, noting locations and gathering support. All this is done with more accuracy and efficiency by harnessing the power of the local residents, community groups and businesses. By providing a tool that makes this implementation seamless the NYC DOT can vet requests and install in a much shorter time frame.</p>
  <h3>Pilot Project</h3>
  <p>Our pilot project is focused on Brooklyn Community District 1 (BKCD1) and only suggestions in this area can be made in this trial period.</p>
  <h3>Who</h3>
  <p>fixcity.org is brought to you by the Livable Streets Initiative and The Open Planning Project. Maps are provided by <a href="http://opengeo.org/">OpenGeo</a>. The pilot project is a collaboration with Transportation Alternatives’ Brooklyn Volunteer Committee and Neighbors Allied for Good Growth. Special thanks to CityRacks Manager Jason Accime for his support and guidance.</p>
