    <li>Make sure suggestion has a good photo of where the rack should go.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Print the <a href="/site_media/resources/PlacementGuide.pdf">rack placement guide</a> to take out with you. Statement of Support is only required for residential buildings and schools. And remember, your arm-span is as wide as you are tall, so you can measure with your own body or bike!</p>
